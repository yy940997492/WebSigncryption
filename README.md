# WebSigncryption
This is a digital signcryption project with a front-end based on umi, a back-end based on express, and a signcryption algorithm based on SCS1 and SCS2.
To start the server first, check the README.md file in the api folder. Finally, to start the client, check the README.md file in the client folder.
The specific signcryption function is located in the 'API/sigcrypt/tools. js' file. By sequentially calling the relevant functions according to the established process, the key distribution, signcryption, unsigncryption, and authentication signcryption of SCS1/SCS2 can be completed.
